This is a rough draft of the VAS flask code that will run an Admin login page for database viewing and
allow presenters to submit their information and presentations.

Currently, the code is in place to allow an Admin to login but no viewing page has been created.
I've have also tried to put in place a hasing algorithm to securely store passwords but has not been tested.

Presenters can access and submit information / presentations via the '/Submit' route.

The schema.sql file is to serve as a quick way to recreate the database but the flask code to run it has
not been implemented yet.
